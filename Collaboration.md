## Team Members
- **Manoj Gowda N** (Backend Developer, LLD, API Testing)  
- **Kartik Bhardwaj** (Frontend Developer, High-Fidelity Design)

## Contributions

### Manoj Gowda N
- Designed and implemented the **Low-Level Design (LLD)** for the project.  
- Built the **backend architecture** including models, controllers, and APIs.  
- **Tested the controllers using Bruno** to ensure all endpoints work as expected before integration.  

### Kartik
- Designed the **high-fidelity UI/UX** prototypes.  
- Implemented the **frontend** using modern frameworks and ensured smooth integration with backend APIs.  
- Focused on responsiveness and maintaining consistency in user experience.

## Challenges Faced
- The major challenge we faced was **design alignment** between frontend and backend.  
- Differences in **approach and expectations** for the UI/UX slowed down initial progress.  
- Integrating **frontend visuals** with backend logic required multiple discussions to reach clarity.  

---

## How We Overcame Challenges
- We held multiple discussions to **brainstorm and align on design choices**.  
- Agreed upon a **common ground** that satisfied both functionality and design aesthetics.  
- Clear division of responsibilities (Backend - Manoj, Frontend/Design - Kartik) helped streamline the workflow.  
- Continuous **communication and feedback loops** allowed us to resolve blockers faster and keep progressing.  

---

## Outcome
- Backend APIs and LLD are in place, tested, and ready for integration.  
- Frontend high-fidelity designs are completed and under implementation.  
- We built a **strong collaboration process** that allowed us to adapt and deliver effectively despite challenges.
